<h1>About me</h1>
<img src="AARGH.jpg" ID="rodo" alt="lol imagine being blind">
<p>My name is Rodolfo Morales and I've been a teenager for about 9 years. I'm of Zapotec, Spanish, and Mixtec dissent. I was raised in the United States and have lived inside Arizona almost my whole life.
    My interests are programming, languages, and reading books. I have a background working in being a stereotypical Mexican stuff like landscaping, cleaning houses, and golf courses. My hope is to get a job being a full stack developer.
    My mama always wanted me to work indoors hahaha :D.
